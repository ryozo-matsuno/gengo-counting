# gengo-counting
Alphabet counting of gengoï¼ˆJapanese-style era name) &amp; bar chart display

Gengo is a Japanese-style era name originated from ancient Chinese Dinasty's one.
Recently the question of what name is the next gengo emerges because Japanese emperor will be changed soon.
Some people argue that the next gengo should have the different head letter to distinguish the next gengo from recent ones.
So I would like to count head letters of the historical gengo and find which letters frequently appear here.

I got the list of histrical gengos below.

I revised this list for programming use and saves the attached csv file.
